  Installing Comufy Rails

You need to add the gem 'comufyrails' to your Gemfile. You can choose any of the following ways, as well
as specifying the version or sub-version.

[code]
gem 'comufyrails'
gem 'comufyrails', :git => "git://github.com/plcstevens/comufyrails.git"
gem 'comufyrails', :path => "/path/to/comufyrails/directory"
[/code]

Afterwards if you run it will install the gem for you.

[cli]
$ bundle install
[/cli]

  Configuring Comufy Rails

Once installed there are a number of ways of using the gem and configuring it.

    Heroku

If you are using this on Heroku then you should add the Comufy addon and go through its initialization steps as it
will handle setting the local environment variables that this gem uses.

TODO - Actually get this fully implemented and working!?

    Other

If you are using this on your local development machine or elsewhere you have two ways to configure this gem. You can
set the values in your config/environments/*.rb in the same manner you set rails-specific values.

[code]
config.comufy_rails.app_name      = 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME'
config.comufy_rails.access_token  = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
config.comufy_rails.base_api_url  = 'COMUFY'
[/code]

     Getting these variables

To actually get these values you'll need to have an account with Comufy, or via our Heroku Comufy service. If you
are using our Heroku service then you can remove the config.comufy_rails.base_api_url from your environment.

TODO - what is the base_api_url for Comufy?

Alternatively you can set these in your environment, where the options are

 *  COMUFY_APP_NAME - Application name (Required!)
 *  COMUFY_USER     - Username of your Comufy account (Optional)
 *  COMUFY_PASSWORD - Password of your Comufy account (Optional)
 *  COMUFY_TOKEN    - Token given to you either by our Comufy Heroku service or from Comufy itself (Optional)

TODO - should base_api_url be an environment variable?
